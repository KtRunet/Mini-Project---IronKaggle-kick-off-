Overview
Your mission is to delve into a dataset of house sale prices for King County, including Seattle, spanning one year from May 2014 to May 2015. This project encompasses various computational tasks such as data loading, visualization, calculating returns, and portfolio analysis, tailored to the real estate domain. It aims to enhance your Python skills, deepen your understanding of real estate financial data, and hone your analytical prowess. Are you ready to embark on this analytical journey through the housing market?

Setup
You'll be undertaking this project in teams, tackling different components of the analysis across three days. The project is designed to simulate real-world real estate analysis scenarios, fostering collaborative problem-solving and the practical application of Python in real estate finance.

About the Data:
This dataset comprises one-year data (from May 2014 to May 2015) of house sale prices across King County, including Seattle. It features 21 different columns, providing a comprehensive overview of the real estate market:

id: A unique identifier for a house.
date: The date on which the house was sold.
price: The sale price of the house (prediction target).
bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the house.
bathrooms: Number of bathrooms in the house, per bedroom.
sqft_living: Square footage of the interior living space.
sqft_lot: Square footage of the land space.
floors: Number of floors (levels) in the house.
waterfront: Whether the house has a waterfront view.
view: Number of times the house has been viewed.
condition: The overall condition of the house.
grade: The overall grade given to the house, based on the King County grading system.
sqft_above: Square footage of the house apart from the basement.
sqft_basement: Square footage of the basement.

zipcode: ZIP code area.
lat: Latitude coordinate.
long: Longitude coordinate.
sqft_living15: The interior living space for the nearest 15 neighbors in 2015.
sqft_lot15: The land spaces for the nearest 15 neighbors in 2015.
TARGET --> Price: Our primary focus is to understand which features most significantly impact the house price. Additionally, we aim to explore properties valued at $650K and above for more detailed insights.
Deliverables:

A Jupyter notebook detailing the analysis and model for predicting house sales prices.
A mini-presentation outlining the machine learning process used in the analysis.
A README file explaining the machine learning steps and decisions made throughout the project.
Presentation time: 6 - 15min.
